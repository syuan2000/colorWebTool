                    Hello and welcome to the homepage of Quantifying Color in Cinema! We are so excited to have you be joining us as a volunteer in our research testing, your participation is valued and crucial to the success of all our hard work over the course of the past few months.
                  <br><br>
                    Over the next couple of paragraphs and pages, we will be going in depth on the purpose of our study, notifying you on obtaining your consent to participate as a test subject in the exam portion of our research, and informing you on the simple how to’s of using our test site.

                    Ever watch a film and wonder why a director chooses the colors that they do throughout a film? Wonder about the repetition of colors and why certain films are more visually appealing than others?
                    <br><br>
                    Over the course of the past 7 months, we as a research team have been asking ourselves the same questions wondering if there is some sort of pattern or predictability when it comes to color palettes (a set of prominent colors within a film) in correlation with Academy Award Nominated/Winning films for Best Cinematography that could be predicted with a series of computer programs/processes.
                    <br><br>
                    Before we could dive more into that, another question arose is whether humans prefer artistically motivated color palettes or mathematical ones generated by empirical data? 
                    <br><br>
                    Through our research and development of the processes to capture the Red, Green, Blue (RGB) color value of every frame of the 50 films from the past ten years of Academy Awards (all nominated films we have analyzed), we have developed 3 types of color palettes representing each frame of film along with the overall color palette of the entire film.
                    We then use these data to assess which palettes participants prefer based on images from the films. This helps us to understand if there are connections between the statistical data collected and the more artistic preferences employed by their creators.
                    For the long-term goal, we also hope that through this research, depending on the findings from the assessment study, that we will be able to determine whether this color summary and analysis program we developed has some meaningful connections that can be used to other areas like enhance search and rescue programs.
